# Time-of-Flight-Calculation-of-Ultrasonic-Gas-Flow-Meter-using-DSP

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB code for the calculation of Time of Flight (TOF) in ultrasonic gas flow meters. The code is developed based on the principles outlined in the research paper titled ["Applications of digital signal processing methods in TOF calculation of ultrasonic gas flowmeter" by Ma, J., Xu, K. J., Jiang, Z., Zhang, L., & Xu, H. R. (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0955598621000479).

### What are Ultrasonic Gas Flow Meters?
Ultrasonic gas flow meters are sophisticated instruments used for measuring the flow rate of gases in various industrial processes. They employ ultrasonic sensors to calculate the velocity of gas flow by measuring the time taken by ultrasonic waves to travel from one transducer to another.

### Importance of Time of Flight in Ultrasonic Gas Flow Meters
Time of Flight (TOF) plays a crucial role in ultrasonic gas flow meters as it directly relates to the velocity of the gas flow. Accurate TOF calculation is essential for precise flow rate measurements and maintaining the efficiency and reliability of industrial processes.

### Special Note
The code provided in this repository is developed with custom-sampled outputs, assuming them to represent ultrasonic sensor readings. While it demonstrates the TOF calculation principles, please note that this code is not perfect. In real-world applications, ultrasonic gas flow meters use dedicated sensors to provide accurate TOF measurements. For optimal accuracy, it is recommended to integrate this code with actual sensor data and process real-time inputs from the gas flow meter.
